Welcome to my home page! I am currently a second-year PhD student in School of Vehicle and Mobility at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html), advised by [Prof. Keqiang Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x58fnLQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Dr. Yang Zheng](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ball4503/index.html). I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree at Tsinghua University in 2018. Feel free to contact me (wang-jw18@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn) if you are interested in my work.
