## Acknowledgement

Besides my advisor Prof. Keqiang Li, I would like to express my special thanks to [Dr. Yang Zheng](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ball4503/index.html), who has been mentoring me since 2018. He helped me through the very first confusion and difficulty in my research and has been giving me valuable suggestions ever since. He is one of the best teachers I have ever met.
