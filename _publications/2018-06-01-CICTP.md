Abstract
---
Previous research on driving safety field theory has shown that driving risk can be perceived as the danger approaches. However, the influence factors of the driver, vehicle, and road are difficult to determine. This study proposes a novel road traffic risk modeling approach based on the dynamic analysis of vehicles in driving scenarios. By analyzing the generation process of traffic risks between vehicles and the road environment, the equivalent forces of vehicle-vehicle and vehicle-road are presented and theoretically calculated. Then the prediction steering angle and trajectory are considered in the determination of traffic risk influence area. Next, the weights of the equivalent force in different prediction trajectories are determined by real free driving experimental data. Finally, the road traffic risk was described as a field of equivalent force. Every road user generates their own field of equivalent force in the road traffic risk map, which was time-varying.
