## Research Contents

- Proposed a time-varying traffic risk model based on the theory of artificial potential field. The generation process of traffic risks for multiple driving scenarios was revealed from vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-environment interaction. Combined with prediction of vehicle trajectories, the traffic risk was described as a field of equivalent force.
- Validated the effectiveness of the proposed traffic risk model according to extensive real driving data. A software was also developed to provide a real-time distribution map of potential traffic risk according to multi-source traffic data.
- Related work has been summarized into one patent and [one conference paper](https://wangjw18.github.io/publication/2018-CICTP), which was demonstrated in 18th COTA International Conference of Transportation Professionals (CICTP) (**Best Paper Award**).
