## Research Contents

- Proposed a report for the influence of typical autonomous driving technologies (*e.g.*, ACC, CACC, AEB, FCW, *etc.*) for car-following and intersection scenarios on traffic efficiency and safety under multiple penetration rates.
- Proposed a comprehensive theoretical understanding to smooth traffic flow via autonomous vehicles. From a control-theoretic perspective, analytical results were established on the controllability, stabilizability, and reachability of a ring-road mixed traffic system consisting of HDVs and one or multiple autonomous vehicles.
- Proved for the first time that a ring-road mixed traffic system with one autonomous vehicle and multiple homogeneous HDVs is not completely controllable, but is stabilizable, indicating that autonomous vehicles can not only suppress unstable traffic waves but also steer the traffic flow to a higher velocity. This theoretic result verified the potential of traffic control via autonomous vehicles.
- Related work was demonstrated in 3rd Annual TRI Joint University Workshop at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, United States, and has been summarized into [one journal paper](https://wangjw18.github.io/publication/2018-arXiv).
