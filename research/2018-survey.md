Role: **Main Participant**. Supported by *HITACHI* and *CHINA MOBILE*. 2018-2019.

## Research Contents

- Proposed a report for the development of CAVs in China, including demands, applications, policies, standards, industry chains, functional safety, etc.
- Participated in proposing the “Roadmap of 5G-based Autonomous Driving” for China (already released) and an international standard related to network-based autonomous driving.
- Analyzed the performance of longitudinal and lateral control of CAVs under imperfect communication conditions (e.g., communication delay and packet loss) by conducting simulation experiments and field tests.
