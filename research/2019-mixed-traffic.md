## Research Contents

- Proved for the first time that the mixed traffic system with one autonomous vehicle and multiple heterogeneous HDVs is stabilizable under a mild condition.
- Proposed an optimal control formulation which enables CAVs to mitigate undesired traffic perturbations actively, instead of responding to traffic perturbations passively (such as ACC or CACC). Considering the possible constraint of communication abilities of CAVs, the formulation was further extended into a structured optimal control problem, and recent advance in sparsity invariance was utilized to derive a convex relaxation.
- Related work has been summarized into [one conference paper](https://wangjw18.github.io/publication/2019-IV), which was demonstrated in 30th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV) in Paris, France.
