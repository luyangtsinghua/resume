Role: **Main Participant**. Supported by *CHINA MOBILE* and *NISSAN*. 2018-present.

## Research Contents

- Participated in proposing the “Roadmap of 5G-based Autonomous Driving” for China (already released) and an international standard related to network-based autonomous driving.
- Analyzed the performance of longitudinal and lateral control of CAVs under imperfect communication conditions (e.g., communication delay and packet loss) by conducting simulation experiments and field tests.
- Currently leading the research on the V2X (especially 5G technology) application structure for mixed traffic systems and cooperative control of multiple CAVs in mixed traffic flow.
