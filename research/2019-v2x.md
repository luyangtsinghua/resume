## Research Contents

- Investigated the optimal cooperative formation for autonomous vehicles in mixed traffic flow, and revealed two predominant optimal formations for the first time: uniform distribution and platoon formation.
- Revealed that the prevailing platoon formation might be the worst choice when HDVs have a poor string stability behavior. This result suggested more opportunities for the formation of autonomous vehicles, beyond platooning, in mixed traffic flow.
- Currently conducting research on the cyber-physical system structure for V2X-based (especially 5G technology) cooperative formation and control of CAVs in mixed traffic flow.
