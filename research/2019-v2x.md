## Research Contents

- Analyzed the performance of longitudinal and lateral control of CAVs under imperfect communication conditions (*e.g.*, communication delay and packet loss) by conducting simulation experiments and field tests.
- Currently leading the research on the V2X application structure for mixed traffic systems and cooperative control of multiple CAVs in mixed traffic flow.
